# Metric: Dependency

 #Activity Metric | Description
---|---
Number of External Components Relied Upon| 1st of several ways to measure upstream reliance
Depth of Reliance on External Components| ? informed by activity metrics or defined by the number "volume" of connections, calls, etc. between the same components
Key CHAOSS Metrics for External Components| this will likely be an average of metrics, possibly weighted by the depth of the reliance|
Number of Projects Using | 1st of several ways to measure downstream reliance
Number of Downloads | Likely needs the help of the project owner to get this information
Depth of Downloads | ? informed by activity metrics or defined by the number "volume" of connections, calls, etc. between the same components
Awareness of Dependency | Number of users who are aware that they depend
Number of Downloads | Likely needs the help of the project owner to get this information

**Disclaimer:**
The activity metrics listed are not meant to represent a fully comprehensive list. It is fully expected that this list will evolve as people have insights and thoughts about the activity metrics that comprise Dependency.

**Tooling:**
The activity metrics are intended to be a starting point for community health related tooling. It is expected that the activity metrics will evolve based on the ability (or inability) of tooling to successfully implement the activity metrics.

**Background:**
The activity metics have been identified based on workshops at the Open Source Leadership and the Open Source Summit North America. In addition, the activity metrics are based on active CHAOSS mailing list conversations. The activity metrics listed here are the result of compiling the discussions to data. We thank everyone who participated.
