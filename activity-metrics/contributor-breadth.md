# Contributor Breadth

Question: 

## Description

Contributor breadth is the ratio of non-core committers to core committers. This metric indicates how open a community is to contributions from outsiders. Drive-by committers (also known as one-time committers) do not build rapport with core committers but their contributions might be accepted based on their quality.
